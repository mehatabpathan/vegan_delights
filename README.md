### Design

The site has a very simple and clean design which was purposely chosen in order to keep in theme with the site's goal. i.e. invoking a sense of calm in the user and reducing stress when it comes to everyday cooking. 

#### Colour Scheme
Colour palette from Coolors

![Colour Palette](docs/readme_images/color_scheme.png)

Throughout the development process, the color scheme underwent several revisions. Ultimately, I opted to adopt a neutral color palette to ensure that the website's purpose remained front and center, without unnecessary distractions. Given that the primary focus of the website is to experiment with and exchange recipes, a white background complemented by subtle light-colored accents felt most appropriate.

For these accents, I selected a golden border, imparting an element of elegance and significance to the showcased recipes. This deliberate choice of colors and highlights aligns with the site's core objectives, contributing to a harmonious and engaging user experience.


#### Imagery
There is only one static image on the site depicting a family dinner on the home page. The rest of the imagery will be uploaded by users for their individual recipes. 

#### Fonts
The Montserrat font is the main font used for the body of the website with the Playfair Display font used for the main headings on the home page. These fonts were imported via Google Fonts. Sans Serif is the backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/mehatabpathan/projects/4)

The 6 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Data Model
I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views.  

Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.

In order for the users to create recipes a custom recipe model was required. The recipe author is a foreign key to the User model given a recipe can only have one author.

The Comment model allows users to comment on individual recipes and the Recipe is a foreign key in the comment model given a comment can only be linked to one recipe. 

The meal plan item model allows users to add recipes to a meal plan for a particular day. A meal plan item can only have one user and one recipe and is therefore linked to the User and Recipe models through foreign keys.

The diagram below details the database schema.

## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User Authentication

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. 
- Django's UserPassesTestMixin is used to limit access based on certain permissions i.e. to ensure users can only edit/delete recipes and comments for which they are the author. If the user doesn't pass the test they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error. 

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom error pages:

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request - The Easy Eater is unable to handle this request.
- 403 Page Forbidden - Looks like you're trying to access forbidden content. Please log out and sign in to the correct account.
- 404 Page Not Found - The page you're looking for doesn't exist.
- 500 Server Error - The Easy Eater is currently unable to handle this request

### Future Features
The following user stories were scoped out of the project due to time constraints and labelled as "Could Have" on the project board in Github. It is intended that these user stories will be implemented at a later date. 

- As a Site User, I can export the ingredients from the recipes on my meal plan to a shopping list and remove the ones that are not necessary so that I can have all my required ingredients for the week in one place.
- As a Site User, I can search and filter recipes so that I can find the one I want.
Searching and filtering

Other potential features include:
- Adding extra categories on the Meal Plan Item for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks so the user can plan out their meals for the full day rather than just for dinner.
- Adding vegan and vegetarian labels to the recipe so the user can filter by these options.

- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

### Create files / directories
- Create requirements.txt file
- Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi

### Update Heroku Config Vars
Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:
- SECRET_KEY value 
- CLOUDINARY_URL
- PORT = 8000
- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1

### Deploy
- NB: Ensure in Django settings, DEBUG is False
- Go to the deploy tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository. 
- Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and either click Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deploys or Deploy Branch to deploy manually. Manually deployed branches will need re-deploying each time the repo is updated.
